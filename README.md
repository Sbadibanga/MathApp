# MathApp
Mobile Application Development third year assignment.

#System specifications

For this coursework I will be developing an application for year 1 students, where they will be able to take a test and see how good they did when it comes to the math for year 1. 
There will need to start button where they are required to enter their first 
and last name and take the test. The results of these test then get put together to create a chart that shows the students result.

The app needs to be able to pick two questions at a time from each topic. These need to be random and I want them to come randomly.  The results should let the student know in a chart on what they need to work more on.

Student: The student should be able to access the app, enter their first and last name, click start. After clicking start it will send the user to the interface where they can view their results or take a new test.

For the database: There is 2 tables in the database, one for the questions, topic id and answer options, and one for the topics. If there is time I´ll attempt to implement a student table with results saved.

The chart: should sum up the results and create a chart showing what topic the student did good and what they didn’t do good. To do this I ´ll create a function that retrieves this data and put it in the chart which will then be stored into the results layout.

#Improvements

Due to the fact that this was an assignment there are some errors that need fixing, to start of the score along with the display of the result and having the saved into a database.

There is a teachers portal that also needs improvement, I was hoping to create an authentication for the teachers portal. The idea was that all the teachers names those emploed that is
would be saved into the database before and teachers would be asked to register on the admin end, which would then add the teachers names into the teachers database and allow them to
log into the app through the teaches protal and that portal would then not be accessible to everyone. but since this was an advanced feature I decided to let it just be as is.

#Future Viewers and Employees 

Hopefully in the futur I´ll be able to update the improvements and it will become a better app and ui.
